once upon a time there lived a monkey who resided in a mango tree,
which was on the banks of a river. in the forest there lived a crocodile and his wife...
one day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree, the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits
the crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits, as he loved them.
